## Sweet Formula 

Sweet Formula is a simple .NET library which is able to evaluate simple mathematic expressions like "unitPrice * qtt * (1 + taxRates)". 
As a developer you could store your formulas within a storage that the end user could edit at run time so that your business rules wouldn't have to be hard coded anymore.

## How to install and use

Currently the project is not mature enough to be useful to anyone yet :)
But have a look at the test project to see how to use it.

In the future, you'll be able to `nuget install Sweet.Formula`
